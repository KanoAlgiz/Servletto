# servletto
Simple application to show basic servlet functionality (starring JUnit, JSP, AJAX & a pinch of jspl)

You need to have an operational Tomcat servlet container to use it.
You can find it here: https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi#8.5.34

After compiling Servletto, put resulting .war file in /webapps folder of your Tomcat.
When Tomcat is running, Servletto will be available at http://localhost:8080/servletto-1.0/index

Press any buttons you like, observe current server state, have fun!
